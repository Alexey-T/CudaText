1.14.4 (2017/08)

+ lexer-specific config + lexer-specific hotkeys config are supported for none-lexer ("lexer -.json", "keys lexer -.json")
+ lexer analysis for big files (>100K, option) is delayed now. Syntax analysis starts only after user ends typing text, and pause passed. Much faster on big files.
+ big optimizations for loading big files (>5Mb); e.g. 280 Mb log loaded before: 22sec, now: 7sec.

+ option "lexer_delayed_parsing_size"
+ option "lexer_delayed_parsing_pause"
+ option "ui_tab_new_near_current"
+ option "unprinted_spaces_trailing"

+ option "indent_makes_whole_line_sel"
+ option "autocomplete_trigger_chars" (like in ST3)
+ option "ui_statusbar_panels" has item for wrap-mode panel (default is hidden)

+ option "wrap_enabled_max_lines", ie disabled word-wrap for huge files (>60K lines) to speedup
+ menu item "View - Toggle micromap"
+ menu item "View - Toggle unprinted chars - Spaces/tabs trailing only"
+ command "toggle word wrap mode (off/window/margin)"
+ Addon Manager: "Install from Github" saves version like "github 2016.10.20"
+ saving file error shows Retry/Cancel message (was OK only)
* removed option "autocomplete_autoshow_lexers" (use lexer-specific configs instead)

lexers:
+ added syntax-theme color for php-tag (<?php ?>)
+ added hilite of php-tag in lexers: HTML, CSS, JS
+ added hilite of standard color names in CSS
* changed link chain of lexers. Was before: PHP includes HTML, HTML includes CSS/JS, CSS/JS includes nothing. Now: HTML includes PHP/CSS/JS, CSS/JS includes PHP, PHP includes nothing. File type *.php is now handled by HTML lexer.
