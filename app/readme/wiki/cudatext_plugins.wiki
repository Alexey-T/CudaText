=Comments=

You can add/remove code comments, via "Comments" plugin. Plugin is preinstalled in CudaText. It gives about 6 commands in menu "Plugins / Comments". Plugin supports only adding/removing of comments, not syntax highlighting for them (highlighting is lexer's work).

* '''Line comments''': from some position to line-end. E.g. in C lexer: "//text here", in Python lexer: "# text here".
* '''Comments for range''' ('''Stream comments'''): from offset to another offset. E.g. in C lexer: "/* text here */".
* '''Comments for full lines''': from newline to another newline. Rarely used, e.g. used in PowerShell.

For example, Python lexer supports only line comment, and don't support stream comments. PowerShell lexer supports comments for full lines, while don't support comments for any range.

Comment chars are editable in SynWrite editor, in dialog "Lexer properties" (after you install the same lexer to SynWrite). In dialog tab "Commenting" you'll see input fields.

Command "Toggle stream comment" in plugin adds/removes comments of last 2 types: for range, for full lines (plugin chooses needed kind).

Comment chars are saved:

* Line comments: in lexer file data/lexlib/nnn.lcf.
* Range comments: in files data/lexlib/nnn.cuda-lexmap.

=Macros=

Macro is a sequence of CudaText actions, which can be saved to a file and invoked later by some command.
To use macros, you must install plugin "Macros" from Addon Manager. It adds "Macros" menu to CudaText main menu bar. This menu gives items:

* Macros...
* Start record
* Stop record
* Cancel record
* Export...
* Import...
* (items for saved macros)

To record a macro:

* call menu item "Macros / Start record", or use dialog "Macros / Macros..." which gives "Start record" button too
* pefrorm some action(s) in CudaText:
** built-in commands, plugin commands (invoked by hotkey, by menu, by Command Palette)
** some mouse actions (clicks/selections, they save/playback relative to caret position)
** calling of Find/Replace dialog, "Go to" dialog
** actions in Find/Replace dialog
* call menu item "Macros / Stop record" to save your macro, plugin will ask for macro name

Macro saves action(s) performed inside its original editor tab (not other tabs). And it doesn't save actions inside plugin dialogs (e.g. FindInFiles).

To playback macro:

* call menu item "Macros / (macro name)", the end of this menu lists all available/saved macros
* or call dialog "Macros / Macros..." which allows to run available macros: it can be simple running, running N times, or running in loop ([x] While text changes, [x] Until caret on last line)

=Project Manager=

This plugin is preinstalled in CudaText. It shows panel "Project" in the sidebar (to show this panel, call plugin by any command, or set plugin's option "Load on program start" and restart, CudaText sidebar will have Project button). On the project panel, on its tree-view, you can add several "root nodes", each node must be existing file or folder. For folder nodes, plugin auto shows all nested folders. You cannot add nodes on other levels (like SynWrite editor does).

Plugin has context menu on its panel, with items:

* Project file
** New project
** Open project
** Recent projects
** Save project as...
** Go to file... - this shows menu with all project files, and then tree-view selection jumps on selected file
** Project properties... - this shows dialog with current project's options
** Config... - this shows dialog with global Project Manager options
* Root nodes - commands for nodes on the project's root level
** Add folder...
** Add file...
** Clear project
** Remove node
* Selected file - it's shown only for files
* Selected directory - it's shown only for folders
* Refresh - it re-reads state of files/folders from disk

Any project can have "main file", you can choose it in the context menu: "Selected file / Set as main file". Main file's path is used by plugin External Tools, when some tool is configured with macro {ProjMainFile}. This allows tools to run compilation of the main file.

==Project Manager options dialog==

* "Ignore files": ";"-separated shell wildcards, which are [https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html documented here]. If file name (without path) matches any of these wildcards, it will not be listed in the treeview.
* "Ignore folders": ";"-separated shell wildcards. If folder name matches any of these wildcards, it will not be listed in the treeview.
* "Ignore all hidden files/folders": Additionally don't list all hidden items. On Unix, hidden mean "beginning with dot". On Windows, hidden means having file-system "hidden" attribute.
* "Use preview tab on item clicking": If option is on, single click on treeview file item, will open file in "preview tab". Preview tab is single such tab, it's shared by all files, it has italic+underlined tab title. If option is off, clicking file item will open normal tab, separate normal tabs per each file.
* "Open file after 'Go to file' command": If turned on, command "Project Manager: Go to file" will not only jump to chosen file in the treeview, but also open that file in editor.
* "Open files by double-click": If turned on, only double-click in the treeview will open file for editing, but not the single click.
* "On opening file in Git/SVN repo...": On opening any file, Project Manager will check if this file is in the Git/SVN repository (by presense of folder ".git" or ".svn" near the file, or in upper level folders). If yes, Project Manager will create the project from that repository and open it. This gives some slowdown of course.
* "File type icons": Set of file/folder icons for treeview. You can install additional themes from Addons Manager, see category "filetypeicons" there. Example of such theme: "VSCode Material 24x24". This option shows  themes, which are present in the folder "data/filetypeicons".
* "Toolbar theme": Set of icons for Project Manager toolbar buttons. You can install additional themes from Addon Manager, see the category "projtoolbaricons" there. This option shows themes, which are present in the folder "data/projtoolbaricons".

==Preview tab==
To see preview tab, call "File / Open folder" and choose a folder with text files. Folder will open in the side panel "Project". Make single click on files in this panel, they will open in "preview tab". Single preview tab is shared by all clicked files in "Project". It has italic caption. When you begin to edit file in this preview tab, tab becomes "normal".

=Snippets=

To use snippets you need:

* plugin "Snippets" (install from Addon Manager)
* snippet package for needed lexer (install from Addon Manager)

Each snippet has a name (shown in the dialog when Snippets plugin is called) and short id (letters, digits, '_', dot). You can type id in editor and press Tab key: snippet for this id will be inserted into text. You can insert snippets also by choosing in dialog: call menu item "Plugins / Snippets".

Only those snippets are enabled, which are suitable for the current lexer. For example, a snippet may be for lexers "C,C++,Objective C" - it is enabled only when these lexers are active. If a snippet has no lexer property, it is always enabled.

Dialog of Snippets plugin:

[[File:cudatext_snippets_menu.png]]

Texts of snippets usually have tab-stop(s), e.g. ${1:some_text}. Plugin Snippets finds tab-stops and places "markers" for them. After markers are placed, Tab-key works special in editor, it jumps to next marker. See detailed information in the [[#Markers]].

==Snippets for HTML tags==

CudaText has preinstalled 120+ snippets for HTML tags. (You still need to install Snippets plugin.) They are enabled with HTML lexer. Just type tag name without a bracket, press Tab, and snippet is inserted. E.g. "a"<Tab> will insert:

  <a href="http" title="Title" target="_blank"></a>

These snippets have markers, so Tab key jumps to the next marker. Last marker is usually placed after the entire tag, ie after ">" bracket.

=Snippet Panel=

Plugin "Snippet Panel" is preinstalled in CudaText. It gives an alternative way to use short text fragments (only simple ones) in editor. It adds button to sidebar, and command "Plugins / Snippet Panel". When called, plugin shows panel in the sidebar, with a drop-down list of folders, which contain several "snippets". You can double-click snippets to insert them into text (multi-carets are supported).

Preinstalled folders:

* Arrows
* Currency symbols
* Greek alphabet (lower)
* Greek alphabet (upper)
* HTML - Arrows
* HTML - Color names
* HTML - Color names+values
* HTML - Letters
* HTML - Math symbols
* HTML - Special characters
* Math symbols
* Quote selection
* Special characters

Plugin looks for its folders in two places:

* Folder "clips" in the plugin folder.
* Folder CudaText/data/clips, which is absent by default, for custom user folders.

Each snippet folder can contain one or more .txt files, in UTF-8 (no BOM) or UTF-16 (with BOM) encoding. Files have snippet per line, in the form "name=value" or simply "name" (if value missed, it equals to name). Each snippet can be simple short string, or string with ${sel} macro to replace selected text. This allows to quote currently selected text by calling snippets from "Quote selection" folder.

=CudaLint=
CudaLint plugin allows to check correctness of documents in many syntaxes.
It was initially ported from SublimeLinter 2.x plugin for Sublime Text. 
Each lexer must be supported with additionally installed linter, for example:

* JavaScript is supported with linter based on JSLint tool,
* HTML is supported with linter based on HTML Tidy tool,
* CSS is supported with linter based on CSSLint tool,
* etc

You will find all linters in the Addon Manager: "Plugins / Addon Manager / Install".
Linters are installable like other plugins but they don't add commands, they only add folders
"[CudaText]/py/cuda_lint_*", which are automatically used by CudaLint.
After you install a linter, see readme in its folder, maybe how-to-use info is written there.

==Linters - usage==
To run linting, use menu item "Plugins / CudaLint / Lint", or set hotkey to this command
(in CudaText Command Palette, press F9). You will see statusbar message, which tells how many errors
linter found. For each found error, you'll see yellow/red bookmark (you can use usual commands
for these bookmarks). Plugin also shows list of errors in the "Validate" panel
(to show Validate panel, click V icon on the CudaText sidebar).

Linting can also be run by events:

* after opening file
* on saving file
* after text is changed + pause passed

Events aren't used by default (to not slowdown usual work). To use events, you must enable them in config.
Call config by menu item in "Options / Settings-plugins".

==Linters - Node.js==
Some linters require Node.js, so for those linters, you must install Node first.
Those linters are sometimes shipped with Node modules preinstalled (in plugin folder)
and sometimes you need to install Node modules via NPM.
See linter's readme file for details.

* Windows: "node.exe" must be in PATH, command "node -v" must work in console.
* Linux: "nodejs" package must be installed, command "nodejs -v" must work in terminal.

==Linters - authoring==
To support more lexers, it's a good idea to port linter from SublimeLinter. To port a linter, most you need is:

* Fix "imports" to use "cuda_lint" module, instead of SublimeLinter modules. cuda_lint gives almost the same classes which SublimeLinter gives. Except Node.js linter class - it's not supported yet. Usual Linter and PythonLinter classes are supported.
* Change syntax name (for Sublime Text) to CudaText lexer name, names are often different. If no such lexer for CudaText exists yet, ask for it.
* Remove in linter usage of Sublime Text API to read settings (often used in linters). You can add usage of settings via CudaText API ini_read, or via json module.
* If linter was using Node.js, take some code to run Node, from cuda_lint_csslint linter.

==Linters - per project==
How to configure linters per project? In your project (Project Manager plugin), right-click root node of project treeview, call menu item "Project file / Project properties...". In this dialog, in the "Variablies" field, enter variable(s) like this:

 linter_css=csslint

Variable prefix "linter_" required, after goes lower-case lexer name (CSS). Value of variable must be name of linter's folder (in "py" folder) without "cuda_lint_". So if linter's folder is py/cuda_lint_aaa, specify value "aaa".

In this example, CudaLint plugin allows, for mentioned lexer CSS, only linter "csslint", even if another CSS linter (e.g. "csstree") is installed and found first.

=External Tools=
==Introduction==

Plugin "External Tools" (ExtTools) can be installed from Addon Manager. It allows to run external programs, catch their output, and display this output in the Output/Validate panels of CudaText. Or to insert/replace some text in the editor.
Plugin adds "Tools" top menu (near "Plugins"), it has item to configure all tools, and items for individual tools.
