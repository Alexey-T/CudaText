Mouse shortcuts

Multi-carets:

    Ctrl+click - add/remove caret.
    Ctrl+drag - add caret with selection.
    Ctrl+Shift+click - add carets column in several lines (from previous caret to clicked line). 

Select:

    Alt+drag - select vertical (column) block.
      Note: it may look weird if word-wrap on, because wrap is not considered here at all. 
      Simple rectangle of coordinates [x1,y1]-[x2,y2] is always selected, even if this gives
      bad looking screen.
    drag on gutter's line numbers - select by entire lines.
    double-click and immediately drag - select text by words. 

Clicks:

    double-click - select clicked word (see option word_chars).
    triple-click - select entire line (limited by end-of-lines).
    
    middle-button click (with option mouse_mid_click_scroll) - start "Browser Scroll" mode: 
      circle mark appears and mouse moving around this mark auto-scrolls text in 4 directions; 
      speed of scrolling depends on distance of cursor from circle mark (any click to turn off).

    middle-button click (with option mouse_mid_click_paste) - paste from clipboard.
      This is like in Linux. Additionally it's good to install plugin "Auto-Copy to Clipboard".

Misc:
       
    Alt+click (with option mouse_goto_definition) - call "Goto definition" command (if plugin installed).
    Shift+ scroll mouse wheel - scroll text horizontally.
    Ctrl+ scroll mouse wheel (with option mouse_wheel_zoom) - zoom text in/out.
