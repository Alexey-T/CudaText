Lexer library file has only subset of lexers.
Other lexers (from SynWrite) are here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/synwrite-addons/files/Lexers/

These zip packages can be installed in CudaText: open any zip file via 
"File--Open" and confirm installation.

Note. After reinstalling of app, lexer library may be reset. You'll need to 
re-add lexers you added. So make a copy of file in "data/lexlib" and set this 
copy name in config: option "lexlib".
