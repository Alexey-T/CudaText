Mouse shortcuts

Multi-carets:

    Ctrl+click - add/delete caret
    Ctrl+drag - add caret with selection
    Ctrl+Shift+click - add carets column in several lines (from previous caret to clicked line) 

Select:

    Alt+drag - select column of text 
      (Note: it may look weird if word-wrap on, because wrap is not considered here at all. 
      Simple rectangle of coordinates [x1,y1]-[x2,y2] is always selected, even if this gives
      bad looking screen)
    drag on gutter's line numbers - select by entire lines
    double-click and immediately drag - select text by words 

Clicks:

    double-click - select clicked word
    triple-click - select entire line (limited by end-of-lines)
    middle-button click - start "Browser Scroll" mode: circle mark appears and mouse moving around 
      this mark auto-scrolls text in 4 directions; speed of scrolling depends on distance of cursor 
      from circle mark (any click to turn off)
       
    Alt+click (option mouse_goto_definition) - call "Goto definition" command (if plugin installed)
